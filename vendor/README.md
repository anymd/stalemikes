Stagetime is a web application that allows comedians who operate comedy shows to list their shows online.  Shows listed will have a "freshness" factor that indicates how recently a show was verified to still be in existence.  The problem with other sites that list shows is that they are not updated when the show gets cancelled.  Stagetime will require users to verify that their shows are still running.  The show's freshness will reflect the most recent verification.
